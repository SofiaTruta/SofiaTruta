ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sofia!

I am a Junior Web Developer.
I have recently completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp and I am super keen on continuing to learn!

Technologies I am familiar with:
JavaScript, HTML, CSS
React, Next.js
Vue.js
Express

Python
Django

MongoDb and PostgreSQL. 

I love exploring component libraries and playing around with styling!
 
 When I'm not coding you can find me at my local rock climbing gym, playing bass or playing videogames (retro games -GB and GB advance forever-  or retro inspired games like Stardew Valley)!
Before web development I worked for 10 years in healthcare as a Nurse.
